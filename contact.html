        <p>
          On LinkedIn I would say "I'm a junior full-stack web developer,
          passionate about learning, creating, and building things up through
          code." Also, I have a BA in Nutrition.
        </p>
        <p>Now, I want to tell you a bit about my story.</p>
        <p>
          At the beginning of 2020, in the middle of the Corona crisis, I
          started studying code. I found out that I like it so much! But I was
          afraid If I could leave my passion for Nutrition and start a new
          career, a new life perhaps?
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess I needed to find out. At the beginning of 2021, I decided to
          start to study code as a full-time job. So I left my current job, and
          I started studying to become a software developer. When I was in the
          process, I found out that coding ‚ú® is my new passion ‚ú® Since there I
          have never stopped coding.
